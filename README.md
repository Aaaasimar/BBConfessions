# BB Confessions

A confessions discord bot that allows users to anonymously post confession to a text channel, but also allows staff to verify the safety of users and prevent abuse.

## Prerequisites

* Node

## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running

The first step is to get a Discord bot setup and ready to be used. Follow this [guide](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) for some help with that.

Once you have a bot, clone the repository. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the root directory:

```
npm install
```

Next, you should set the environment variable for the bot. Copy the '.env.template' file and rename to '.env' and update the placeholders.

Finally, start the bot.

```
node index.js
```
